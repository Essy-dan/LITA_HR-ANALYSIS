### HR DATA ANALYSIS DOCUMENTATION

### Project Overview

This project covers a Human Resource (HR) Data of a company that has been in existence for Forty (40) years. This data has both quantitative and qualitative variables, and insights are drawn from this data to know the trends of Attrition and Current employees in the company. The insights drawn will also proffer accurate decision making to know how to curb the rate of attrition in the company.
Data Source
The dataset is public dataset through incubators Hub.

### Insights

1. High Attrition in Research and Development (R&D)

**Project-Based Work:** R&D roles can be heavily project-driven, with project completions sometimes leading employees to seek new challenges elsewhere.

Work Pressure and Burnout: R&D often involves high-intensity, innovation-driven work, sometimes with longer hours, which can lead to burnout if not managed well.

**Skillset Demand:** R&D roles typically require specialized skills. Professionals in these roles may be offered higher salaries or more appealing work conditions by competitors, making it easier to switch jobs.

**Limited Advancement Opportunities:** If R&D teams don’t provide clear advancement paths, employees may leave to pursue higher positions or broader experiences in other organizations.

2. Attrition by Education Field

Life Sciences and Medical Fields: These fields often involve specialized skills and high job demands. Attrition in these areas could be driven by:

**Stress and Burnout:** Life sciences and medical fields can be high-stress, especially in roles with intense workloads or where continuous education is

required.

**High Demand and Competitive Offers:** Professionals in these fields are in demand, making them attractive to competitors. They may receive frequent 

offers for higher pay or better working conditions.

Desire for Career Growth: Employees with medical or life sciences backgrounds might pursue further specialization, research roles, or career shifts within

healthcare, leading to higher turnover.

**Marketing and Technical Degrees:** These areas can also see higher attrition due to:

**Skill Demand and Market Volatility:** Both fields see rapid changes in industry standards and technology, pushing professionals to constantly update 

their skills. People in marketing may move for better opportunities or roles that offer higher creative autonomy, while technical professionals might

switch for advanced projects or cutting-edge technology.

**Career Fluidity:** Especially in marketing, where creativity and networking play major roles, job-hopping is common as people seek to build diverse

portfolios.

Human Resources (HR): HR often has the lowest attrition because:

**Consistency and Stability:** HR professionals typically stay longer within organizations as they build relationships, understand company culture deeply, 

and manage processes that require stability.

**Fewer External Pull Factors:** HR roles may not have as many competing offers or market-driven pressures as technical or medical fields, making 

professionals in HR less likely to switch jobs.

3. Attrition by age groups

**Age Group 25 to 34** (Highest Attrition)

Career Development and Growth: Employees in this age group are often looking for opportunities to advance, gain new skills, or take on leadership roles.

If they feel their current job doesn't offer these opportunities, they may look elsewhere.

Exploring New Industries or Roles: This is a common age for experimenting with career shifts or trying out new fields, leading to higher turnover.

Life Changes: This period frequently involves major life events like marriage, starting families, or pursuing further education, which can prompt job 

changes.

Competitive Job Market: Professionals in this age range often have developed skills and experience, making them attractive to other employers who might

offer better compensation or benefits.

2. Age Group Under 25 (Second Highest Attrition)

Early Career Exploration: Employees under 25 are typically entry-level and may still be exploring different career paths, leading to higher turnover as

they seek roles that better fit their aspirations.

Job Security and Stability: Entry-level positions can sometimes offer lower job security or benefits, pushing younger employees to switch to positions

with better prospects.

Skill-Building: Younger employees may move frequently to build skills and broaden their experience, especially if they find that the current role isn’t 

meeting their developmental needs.

3. Age Group 35 to 44

Stabilizing Careers: Employees in this age group often have more stable career paths, which can lead to lower attrition compared to younger age groups.

Work-Life Balance: At this stage, people may prioritize stability and work-life balance over constant job-hopping, making them less likely to leave unless

there’s a strong incentive.

Increased Responsibilities: Many employees in this range are in mid-career, potentially with managerial responsibilities, which can foster a sense of

loyalty and attachment to their roles.

4. Age Group 45 to 50

Higher Job Tenure: Employees in this age range often have established roles and may have built significant experience within the company, which could

reduce their desire to leave.

Fewer External Opportunities: In some cases, older professionals may find fewer opportunities externally or prefer the stability of their current role

especially if they have built up seniority.

Retirement Considerations: Some employees in this group may start thinking about retirement plans, making them more likely to stay until they are closer 

to retirement age.

5. Over 55 Years of Age (Lowest Attrition)

Job Security and Stability: This group often values stability and continuity as they approach retirement, making them less likely to leave voluntarily.

Institutional Knowledge: Older employees often have deep institutional knowledge, which companies value, and they may have reached senior positions that

make them more comfortable staying.

Retirement Planning: Employees over 55 are generally less likely to leave as they may be focused on securing benefits and preparing for retirement.

These trends highlight a mix of career, personal, and financial motivations that drive attrition differently across age groups. Understanding these 

underlying reasons can help companies tailor their retention strategies—such as offering career growth opportunities to younger employees or stability

incentives to older ones—to address each group’s needs and reduce overall attrition.

### Recommendation

1. Age Group 25-34 (Highest Attrition)

Recommendation: Provide clear career development opportunities and pathways for advancement. This age group often seeks growth, so offering leadership training, mentorship programs, and skill development courses can meet these needs and increase retention.

Enhance Role Variety: Allow employees to take on diverse projects or cross-functional roles to keep their work engaging. Job rotation within the department can also help them gain new experiences without needing to change companies.

Flexible Work-Life Options: Since employees in this group may face significant life changes, offering flexible work arrangements, remote work options, or support for work-life balance can help address these challenges and reduce attrition.


2. Age Group Under 25 (Second Highest Attrition)

Recommendation: Implement onboarding and mentorship programs tailored to early-career employees. Help them understand career paths within the company and give them a sense of purpose and growth potential early on.

Offer Learning and Development Opportunities: Young employees often value skill-building. Providing them with access to training or courses can help satisfy their desire for growth and reduce the temptation to leave for similar positions elsewhere.

Create Clear Paths for Progression: This age group may be unsure of their future career steps, so defining clear, attainable paths for advancement can help retain talent and give them goals to work toward within the organization.


3. Research and Development Department (High Attrition)

Recommendation: Address burnout and project pressure by ensuring that work is well-distributed and that project deadlines are manageable. Regularly check in with R&D employees on workload and mental health
